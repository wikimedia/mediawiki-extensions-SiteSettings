Site Settings extension for MediaWiki.

This extension allows users with administrative privileges to modify the
wiki's settings via a special page on the wiki itself, at
Special:SiteSettings.

Other extensions can add their own settings to the page, via hooks.

For more information, see the extension homepage at:
