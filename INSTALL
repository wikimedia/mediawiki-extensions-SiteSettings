The extension requires an install of MediaWiki 1.19 or greater.

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SiteSettings" that contains
    all relevant files. Copy this directory (or extract/download it) to
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once( 'extensions/SiteSetting/SiteSettings.php' );
(3) Add the following line below it, also in LocalSettings.php:
      $wgSiteSettingsSetupMode = true;
(4) Call a database update, such as by calling the following script, within
    MediaWiki's /maintenance directory:
      php update.php
(5) Once the "sitesettings" database table has been created, remove the
    $wgSiteSettingsSetupMode line from LocalSettings.php.
